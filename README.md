Machine learning is a field of study and is concerned with algorithms that learn from examples.  Classification is a task that requires the use of machine learning algorithms that learn how to assign a class label to examples from the problem domain. An easy to understand example is classifying emails as “spam” or “not spam.”  There are many different types of classification tasks that you may encounter in machine learning and specialized approaches to modeling that may be used for each.  In this tutorial, you will discover different types of classification predictive modeling in machine learning.
##What is the Classification Algorithm?
The Classification algorithm is a Supervised Learning technique that is used to identify the category of new observations on the basis of training data. In Classification, a program learns from the given dataset or observations and then classifies new observation into a number of classes or groups. Such as, Yes or No, 0 or 1, Spam or Not Spam, cat or dog, etc. Classes can be called as targets/labels or categories.

Unlike regression, the output variable of Classification is a category, not a value, such as "Green or Blue", "fruit or animal", etc. Since the Classification algorithm is a Supervised learning technique, hence it takes labeled input data, which means it contains input with the corresponding output.

In classification algorithm, a discrete output function(y) is mapped to input variable(x).
The best example of an ML classification algorithm is Email Spam Detector.

The main goal of the Classification algorithm is to identify the category of a given dataset, and these algorithms are mainly used to predict the output for the categorical data.

Classification algorithms can be better understood using the below diagram. In the below diagram, there are two classes, class A and Class B. These classes have features that are similar to each other and dissimilar to other classes.
